Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis
Introduction
This data science project focuses on analyzing historical data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Through comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling, we aim to understand the trends and factors influencing these emissions over time. This insight is crucial for informing policy and contributing to global climate crisis mitigation efforts.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical GHG emissions data to determine the environmental and economic factors that influence these emissions. By understanding these factors, we can provide actionable insights to policymakers and the public.

# Methodology
The project employs several data science techniques:
1] Data Preparation: Cleaning and structuring data for analysis.
2] Exploratory Data Analysis: Using statistical tools to explore and summarize the characteristics of the data.
3] Visualization: Creating visual representations to illustrate trends and patterns in GHG emissions.
4] Predictive Modeling: Implementing machine learning models like Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression to predict factors affecting energy use and emissions.

# Key Findings
1] Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LUCF) significantly impact GHG emissions.
2] Economic activities are closely correlated with changes in emission levels.
3] Predictive models help in understanding the future trends of GHG emissions based on historical data.
